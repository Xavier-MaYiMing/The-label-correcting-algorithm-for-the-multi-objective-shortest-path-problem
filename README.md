##### Reference: Paixão J M, Santos J L. Labeling methods for the general case of the multi-objective shortest path problem–a computational study[M]//Computational Intelligence and Decision Making. Springer, Dordrecht, 2013: 489-502.

The multi-objective aims to find a set of paths with minimized costs.

#### Example

![image](https://github.com/Xavier-MaYiMing/The-label-correcting-algorithm-for-the-multi-objective-shortest-path-problem/blob/main/MOSPP.png)

The red number associated with each arc is the first weight, and the green number is the second weight.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_network = {
        0: {1: [62, 50], 2: [44, 90], 3: [67, 10]},
        1: {0: [62, 50], 2: [33, 25], 4: [52, 90]},
        2: {0: [44, 90], 1: [33, 25], 3: [32, 10], 4: [52, 40]},
        3: {0: [67, 10], 2: [32, 10], 4: [54, 100]},
        4: {1: [52, 90], 2: [52, 40], 3: [54, 100]},
    }
    source_node = 0
    destination_node = 4
    print(main(test_network, source_node, destination_node))
```

##### Output:

```python
[
    {'path': [0, 2, 4], 'objective': [96, 130]}, 
    {'path': [0, 3, 4], 'objective': [121, 110]}, 
    {'path': [0, 3, 2, 4], 'objective': [151, 60]},
]
```
